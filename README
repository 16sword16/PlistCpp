DESCRIPTION
-----------------

This is a serializaiton library for Apple Property Lists (plists).  It supports
both XML and binary versions of the plist format.  The interface is simply a
set of static methods which serialize/deserialize stdlib containers.  

It uses boost::any as a generic type in order to support heterogenous
containers, e.g. a dictionary is a map<string, any> and an array is a
vector<any>.  The association between stdlib types and plist types is shown
below

plist           C++
____________________________________________________________

string          std::string 
integer         short, int, int32_t, int64_t
real            double
dictionary      std::map<std::string, boost::any>
array           std::vector<boost::any>
date            PlistDate (included class in PlistDate.hpp)
data            std::vector<char>
boolean         bool

-----------------
USAGE
-----------------

See src/plistTests.cpp for examples of reading and writing all types to both
XML and binary.  E.g. to read a plist from disk whose root node is a
dictionary:

		map<string, boost::any> dict; 
		Plist::readPlist("binaryExample1.plist", dict);

The plist format (binary or XML) is automatically detected so call the same
readPlist method for XML

		Plist::readPlist("XMLExample1.plist", dict);

To write a plist, e.g. dictionary

		map<string, boost::any> dict;
		populateDictionary(dict);
		Plist::writePlistXML("xmlExampleWritten.plist", dict);

and for a binary plist

		Plist::writePlistBinary("binaryExampleWritten.plist", dict);

The other public methods allow for reading and writing from streams and byte
arrays.  Again, see the test suite code src/plistTests.cpp for comprehensive
examples.

INSTALL
-----------------

Simply copy src/Plist.hpp, src/PlistDate.hpp, src/pugixml.hpp,
src/pugiconfig.hpp, src/base64.hpp and src/pugixml.cpp to your project.  If you
do not have boost::any installed on your system, also grab the include/boost
folder which contains the minimum boost headers needed for boost::any.

To compile and run the test suites (test suites will also run automatically as
part of the post build process).  Note, the UnitTest++ library is required and
included.
